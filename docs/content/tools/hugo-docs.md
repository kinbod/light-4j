title: Hugo for project documentation on github
---

## Introduction

**This tutorial is written for Linux and Mac; however, it should not be hard to follow by Windows users.**

For most open source developers, they would ues github.com to manage their projects and 
then have a README.md for documentation. For some bigger projects they might have wiki 
for additional documents and linked them from README.md.

Here I will introduce another way to manage documents in gh-pages with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 
static site generator.

## Installation

### Hugo

For Linux, download the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases)

I am using hugo_0.17-64bit.deb on ubuntu and install it with the following command.


```

sudo dpkg -i hugo_0.17-64bit.deb
```

To verify that Hugo is installed successful.

```
hugo version
```

For Mac, the easiest way is to use Homebrew.

```
brew update && brew install hugo
```


### Pygments

The Hugo executable has one optional external dependency for source code highlighting (Pygments). 
To install it

```
pip install Pygments
```

### Enable Hugo Bash Auto-Completion

```
sudo hugo gen autocomplete
. /etc/bash_completion
```

Now if you type hugo followed by a few TABs, you will see the commands that Hugo recommended.

## Create gh-pages branch

GitHub Pages will serve up a website for any repository that has a branch called gh-pages 
with a valid index.html file at that branchâ€™s root.

1. Create an orphaned gh-pages branch

To set up a Project Pages site, you need to create a new "orphan" branch (a branch that 
has no common history with an existing branch) in your repository. The safest way to do 
this is to start with a fresh clone:

```
git clone github.com/user/repository.git
cd repository
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
```

2. Remove all files to create an empty working directory

```
git rm -rf .

```

3. Add test index.html and push

```
echo "My Page" > index.html
git add index.html
git commit -a -m "initial checkin"
git push origin gh-pages
```

4. Test your site

After push to gh-pages, your site will be available at the following url.

```
https://<orgname>.github.io/<reponame>
```

## Scaffold docs site

First switch to master branch
```
git checkout master
```

Create a new docs site

```
hugo new site docs
```

Now you have a docs directory in your project root folder and some empty sub 
directories under docs. By default, git will not commit empty directories to the 
repository. To work around it, we can include .gitkeep file in each of these
directories.

```
cd docs
for DIR in `ls -p | grep /`; do touch ${DIR}.gitkeep; done
```
To verify that these files are created.

```
find . -name .gitkeep
```
## Config

Copy the content of [my config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/networknt/light-4j/master/docs/config.toml)
into config.toml under docs and update it accordingly

## Theme

I am using hugo-material-docs theme and here is the steps to install it.

```
cd docs/themes
git clone git@github.com:digitalcraftsman/hugo-material-docs.git
```

## Content
Now let's create the first page and test it.

1. From docs folder, run

```
hugo new index.md
```
2. Find the file docs/content/index.md and update it with some testing content

3. Start the server and test it.

From docs folder

```
hugo server
```
4. Now you about.md can be accessed at

```
http://localhost:1313/<reponame>
```

## Deploy

Get the deploy.sh

```
# Fetch the deployment script into the root of your source tree, make it executable.
wget https://github.com/X1011/git-directory-deploy/raw/master/deploy.sh && chmod +x deploy.sh

```
From docs folder run the following command to publish your site to gh-pages. This 
can be repeated every time you want to publish your site.

```
# For setting it up to build to a folder other than "dist", see the options in deploy.sh.
# Build the site to /dist.
hugo -d dist

# Run the deploy.sh script installed above.
./deploy.sh
```

Now you document site can be accessed from https://<username>.github.io/<projectname>

## Check in

You site is up and running now, let's check it in before adding more documents

```
cd ..
git add .
git commit -m "add docs for documentation"
git push origin master
```
