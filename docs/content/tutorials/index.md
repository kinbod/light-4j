In the beginning, we only have one framework that supports restful API for building microservices
and now we have several frameworks to build microservices based on the type of services customers
want to build. Majority of our customers are using all types of the frameworks to build their services

If you are unsure which framework to use for your service, please refer to this [article](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/architecture/category/)


The following tutorials will help users to get started and more will be added later. They are not
specific to individual framework but explains concept in general. 


* [How to do unit test](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/tutorials/unit-test/)

* [How to do end-to-end test](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/tutorials/end-to-end-test/)

* [How to do integration test](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/tutorials/integration-test/)

* [How to debug the service](https://networknt.github.io/light-4j/tutorials/debug/)


As different frameworks work slightly differently, the tutorials are reside in each individual
framework document site. Here is a list of links:
