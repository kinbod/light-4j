title: Handling Partial Failure
---

# Introduction

In a distributed system there is the ever-present risk of partial failure. Since clients and services 
are separate processes, a service might not be able to respond in a timely way to a clientâ€™s request. 
A service might be down because of a failure or for maintenance. Or the service might be overloaded 
and responding extremely slowly to requests. Also, as services are distributed across networks or even
data centers, it increases the risk of partial failures especially you have too many small services
interact each other to form a big application. 

# Cascade Failure

Consider you have a aggregate service that call five other services to serve a SPA running on the 
browser. If one of the five services is unresponsive, the aggregate service might block indefinitely
waiting for a response. Not only would that result in a poor user experience, but in many applications
it would comsume a valuable resource called thread. Eventually the server will run out of threads and
become unresponsive. If this happens in a long chain with a lot of services, on failure will be cascaded
to others and to brought down the entire application. 

This is particularly serious in services built on top of Java EE stack due to the blocking nature. If
all services are built on top of asynchronous http server with non-blocking IO. The risk is significantly
reduce. 

# Solution

To prevent the problem described above, it is essential that you design your services to handle partial 
failures.

A good to approach to follow is the one described by Netflix. The strategies for dealing with partial 
failures include:

- Network timeouts 

Never block indefinitely and always use timeouts when waiting for a response. Using timeouts ensures 
that resources are never tied up indefinitely.

- Limiting the number of outstanding requests 

Impose an upper bound on the number of outstanding requests that a client can have with a particular 
service. If the limit has been reached, it is probably pointless to make additional requests, and those 
attempts need to fail immediately.

- Circuit breaker pattern 

Track the number of successful and failed requests. If the error rate exceeds a configured threshold, 
trip the circuit breaker so that further attempts fail immediately. If a large number of requests are 
failing, that suggests the service is unavailable and that sending requests is pointless. After a 
timeout period, the client should try again and, if successful, close the circuit breaker.

- Provide fallbacks 

Perform fallback logic when a request fails. For example, return cached data or a default value such 
as empty set of objects.
